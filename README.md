# Computer-Vision-Project: Person detection Model Using YOLO
Created a person detection in movie frames model using YOLO.

 

 

**Tasks:** 
- Clone this repository
- Integrate your custom dataset into the YOLO framework (transfer learning).
- Fine-tune the YOLO model using your dataset. This involves adjusting the model's parameters to better suit your specific data.
- Conduct evaluation of your fine-tuned YOLO model. Use appropriate metrics to assess its performance (e.g., precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, etc.).
